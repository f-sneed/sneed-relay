# SNEED Relay

WebExtension for relaying chat messages to [stream-nexus](https://github.com/jaw-sh/stream-nexus) with WebSockets.

**Currently functional but subject to heavy change.**

## How to use

Right now, this is not yet available as a normal extension. You will have to load it a special way.

First, clone the repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/y-a-t-s/sneed-relay.git
```

**Firefox**: Go to `about:debugging` -> `This Firefox` -> `Load temporary Add-on`.

**Chromium-based**: Go to `Extensions`, enable `Developer mode` at the top-right, and click `Load unpacked`.
Exact instructions may vary based on your specific flavor of Chromium.

**Safari/WebKit**: [¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/developing_a_safari_web_extension)
